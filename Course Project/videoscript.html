    <h2>
        The key to successful job search is a strong resume and cover letter. Give your name, phone number and email at the top of the page. List education, skills and experiences. Try to use phrases and verbs for showing your skills. The ideal length of resume
        is two pages. Cover letter is an opportunity to stand out from the crowd. It should be maximum 1 page long with 600 words. Try to relate everythng back to job description. There is no specific way of writing resume but confidence is the key to
        success.
